What is the difference between regression testing and retesting?
Regression testing is performing tests to ensure that modifications to a 
module or system do noT have a negative effect on previous releases. 
Retesting is merely running the same testing again.

Explain the difference between bug severity and bug priority.
Bug severity refers to the level of impact that the  bug has on the application or system while bug  priority 
refers to the level of urgency in the need for a fix.
Usually the severity is defined in terms of financial loss, damage to environment, company's reputation and 
loss of life. Priority of a defect is related to how quickly a bug should be fixed and deployed to live servers.

Tell me your project?
I'm currently working on an application in which my team are specifically focused on search FUNCTIONALITY.

Can you describe your daily activity?
Tell Me About Your Daily Activities 
• My shift starts at 8am, first thing first I double check the results of my smoke test, make sure that the
application is up and running.
• Then I am focusing on my emails which I received yesterday after I left my desk, to make sure that i am note
missing anything from yesterday.
• Then i am opening my Jira board, basically getting ready for my daily stand up which occurs at 10 am everyday.
• At stand up as a team we discuss what we did yesterday what we are working on right now and more
importantly if there is anything that holding me to do my job, impediments.
• After stand up i go back to my desk and depending on which part of sprint our team is my tasks differ.
• Lets say if it is early sprint i would participate in sprint planning meeting where we go over the user stories and
pointing them.
• Also I would work on maintaining my framework, participate in test scenario reviews. 

• Towards the mid sprint where the code is being released i
would complete my automation and start execution.
• if it is end of the sprint I would be busy for getting reports
ready and participate in demo meeting.
• Also I we have retro meeting at the end of the sprint.
• Every Tuesdays we have lunch and learn session where I share
my coding and automation experience with my fellow manual
testers,
• Also every friday we have code review meeting among
automation testers of the project.

 
Tell Me About your responsibilities
• Well, As I am an SDET my main responsibility is test automation.
•  One of my main responsibilities is to automate, run and maintain smoke test suite.
• I am also responsibly for maintaining, automating test scenarios for regression suite and for sure executing it which will
include reporting as well.
• As a cross functional team member I am responsible for reviewing test scenarios with my peer manual test team members
and figuring out good candidates for automations.
• Also reviewing my code with automation testers in order make sure that we are following the best practices for our team.
• As we are implementing Agile, I am attending to Daily stand ups, where we are talking what we are doing what we did and
are the any impediments.
• I am attending Sprint planning in every sprint where we discuss user stories, give points and assign it to team members and
demos, where I usually present what as a team we have accomplished.
